# Data_Engineering_Project
## Project Objective: Creating an Efficient Data Pipeline
The company Gans, which shares E-scooters, is the subject of this project.
Our goal is to provide a system that makes it simple to collect, handle, and store data from many sources.
The main goal is to draw conclusions from this data that will guide our decision-making.
We're going to switch from doing this on one computer to using the cloud, so it can grow and work by itself.

## About Gans E-Scooter Shairing company
Gans is a startup focusing on e-scooter sharing services, aiming to operate globally in populous cities. It competes with companies like TIER and Bird.
Unlike other e-scooter firms, Gans realizes that scooter placement is crucial for success. Users need access to scooters where they are. 
Different factors lead to scooter movement asymmetry for example In hilly cities, scooters move uphill with users but downhill is often walked.
Mornings see movement from homes to city centers.Rain reduces scooter use significantly.Young tourists need scooters downtown or at tourist spots. 
Gans plans to use trucks or incentives for users to balance scooter distribution.
Gans aims to predict scooter movement for better operations. Data collection and transformation are initial steps. 
The challenge is to build an automated cloud-based data pipeline for real-time data accessible to all.

## Our Role: 
Collect data from external sources to help predict e-scooter movement. Assemble an automated cloud data pipeline for daily, real-time access by the company.

## Code used 
Code folder has script to run lambda function  and function for local data base.
